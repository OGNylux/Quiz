# Quiz (Ionic + Angular + Capacitor)

Simple mobile quiz app with Ionic, Angular and Capacitor.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Ionic CLI (optional, but recommended for development)

## Install

Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you prefer the Ionic CLI globally (optional):

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

## Run (development)

Start the dev server (uses the Angular CLI script `start`):

```bash
npm start
# or (if you have the Ionic CLI)
ionic serve
```

The dev server will serve the app at http://localhost:4200 by default.
